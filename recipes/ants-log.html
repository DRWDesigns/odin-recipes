    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a fun snack that kids can make. It consists of artfully arranged celery, peanut butter, and raisins.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) bone-in chicken thighs, with skin</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 stalks celery, chopped</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>3 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

        <li>Rinse chicken thighs and pat dry with paper towels. Heat oil in the pot of an electric pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) on Sauté mode; add chicken. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving drippings in the pot.</li>
        
        <li>Place mushrooms, celery, and onion in the pot; cook and stir until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Place chicken back in the pot; add tomatoes and tomato paste. Sprinkle with herbes de Provence. Top with water and bouillon.</li>
        
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build. Cook for 11 minutes.</li>
        
        <li>Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid carefully, turning it away from you. Test chicken for doneness; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season to taste with red pepper flakes and black pepper.</li>
    </ol>
